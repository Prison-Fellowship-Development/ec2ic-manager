# EC2 Instance Connect Manager

**EC2 Instance Connect Manager** is a GUI application that simplifies connecting to EC2 instances via [AWS EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html). Instead of using the AWS CLI, users can browse their instances and initiate secure sessions with just a few clicks.
