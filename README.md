# EC2 Instance Connect Manager

**EC2 Instance Connect Manager** is a GUI application that simplifies connecting to EC2 instances via [AWS EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html). Instead of using the AWS CLI, users can browse their instances and initiate secure sessions with just a few clicks.

- Make sure your IAM user/role has the necessary EC2 permissions, such as:
  - `ec2:DescribeInstances`
  - `ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey`
- The app uses a random local port to tunnel RDP traffic securely through the EC2 instance connect session.
